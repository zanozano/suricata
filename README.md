**Version:** 2.0.0

## Description

This is a dynamic landing page project designed for the marketing of food products. Utilizing the Bootstrap framework as its foundation, the project combines the power of SCSS and follows the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology to create a modular and maintainable codebase.

With a strong emphasis on user interaction, the user interface (UI) has been meticulously crafted. Hover effects and CSS pseudo-classes have been strategically implemented to enhance user engagement and create an immersive browsing experience. Explore our delicious offerings and seamlessly navigate through our visually appealing and user-friendly design.
