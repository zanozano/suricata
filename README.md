**Version:** 2.0.0

## Description

Welcome to the Suricata Landing Page, a dynamic project designed to market food products. We've harnessed the power of Bootstrap as the project's foundation, complemented by the versatility of SCSS and adhering to the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology. This approach ensures a modular and maintainable codebase.

Our focus extends beyond aesthetics; we've meticulously crafted the user interface (UI) to engage users effectively. Hover effects and strategic CSS pseudo-classes create an immersive browsing experience. Dive into our delectable offerings and experience seamless navigation through our visually appealing and user-friendly design.
